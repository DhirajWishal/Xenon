# Xenon Documentation

Xenon is a graphics engine primarily developed as a learning curve and to test different new systems out, like global illuminations, animations, acceleration structures and other graphics technologies used in offline or online rendering applications. Initially this was a personal project to learn how to develop a graphics engine with multiple backends (Vulkan and DirectX 12) but it has grown to a point where we can actually do much more than just to implement a simple graphics engine with two backends. For now it only contains a very limited set of functionalities but it will grow to a more powerful piece of technology!

## Get started

To test the engine out, just head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nexonous/Xenon) and use the readme file there to get started.
